Documenting a Small Personal Project:

Goal: Track the development of a simple project (e.g., a to-do list app, a simple calculator).

GitHub Steps:

Create a new repository (name it appropriately).
Create a README.md file to explain the project.
Add your project files (code, assets, etc.).
Make frequent commits as you develop, with clear commit messages.

Learning Focus: README files, organizing project files, committing best practices.
