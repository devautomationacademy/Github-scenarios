Adding a New Feature (Branching Workflow):

Goal: Add a new feature to your personal project without disrupting the main code.

GitHub Steps:

Create a new branch (e.g., feature/new-feature).
Make your changes on that branch.
Commit your changes on the feature branch.
Create a pull request (PR) to merge the feature/new-feature branch into the main branch.
Review your changes in the PR (pretend you're another developer).
Merge the PR.

Learning Focus: Branching, creating pull requests, reviewing code, merging.
