Fixing a Bug (Issue Tracking & PR):

Goal: Address a problem in your project through the issue tracking system and a fix branch.

Commit and push.
Create a pull request to merge the fix/bug-description branch into main.
In the PR description, reference the issue number (e.g., "Fixes #1").
Merge the PR.
Close the issue.

Learning Focus: Issue tracking, bug fixing, referencing issues in PRs.
