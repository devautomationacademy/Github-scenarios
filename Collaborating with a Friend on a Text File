Collaborating with a Friend on a Text File:

Goal: Jointly edit a document, such as a story or a list.

GitHub Steps:

Create a repository.
Add a document.txt or document.md file.
Invite your friend as a collaborator.
Both of you can:
Clone the repository to your local machines.
Make changes to the file.
Commit and push your changes.
Pull changes from each other.

Learning Focus: Collaboration, cloning, pushing, pulling, merge conflicts (if you both edit the same part).
