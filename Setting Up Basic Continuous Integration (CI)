Setting Up Basic Continuous Integration (CI):

Goal: Automatically run tests every time you push changes.

GitHub Steps:

Write some tests for your project (you can start with very basic tests).
Create a workflow file in .github/workflows/ (e.g., test.yml).
Define steps in the workflow to set up your environment, install dependencies, and run tests.
Push changes to trigger the workflow.
Check the "Actions" tab in your repository to see the test results.

Learning Focus: CI, GitHub Actions, writing workflow files.
